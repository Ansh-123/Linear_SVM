# Linear_SVM
A linear support vector machine written from scratch in python (save for basic matrix multiplication). Also contains code for visualization of data and margins for 2d data.


# Example
Main.py provides a sample use case the SVM class, utilizing the following data:
data_raw = [[-1, -1, -1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [-1, -2, -1], [-2, -1, -1]].

Pretraining, the bboundary hyperplane is set to:

And postraining, the SVM finds the ideal soultion as seen in the image below:
